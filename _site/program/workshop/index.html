                                <p>Virtual reality is already over 50 years old. While consumers are now appreciating modern devices that are easy to use, this workshop will celebrate some of the pioneering work that brought us to this point. We are interested in demonstrating, and starting to archive in more detail, not just the hardware, but the experiences that older VR systems presented. Thus, while one can see pictures of old, often cumbersome, head-mounted displays, we feel that there is a need to preserve video, or ideally immersive experiences, of these systems to convey the trajectory of research. That is, we want to explore what was engaging about these immersive experiences, and why they inspired such a wide variety of research and media interest. The goal of the workshop is thus to bring together people interested in the problem of preserving the best possible media about these systems.</p>

                                <p>In recent years, researchers have begun capturing and logging data from consumer virtual reality (VR) experiences, such as Half-Life: Alyx and Beat Saber. Such ecologically valid datasets afford numerous research insights and capabilities not possible with traditional study designs and implementations. This workshop focuses on how such ecologically valid datasets can be captured, what insights they afford, and their various use cases (e.g., identifying users based on their VR tracking data). This workshop is also a platform for presenting and discussing datasets captured from openly available VR and extended reality (XR) applications, including non-consumer projects.</p>

                                <p>Extended reality has finally become a mainstream technology. Recent advances in commercial VR and the calls by big tech companies to build the "Metaverse", have increased interest in the medium. This interest forced designers from different backgrounds to look for effective ways to communicate their ideas to technical developers and rapidly prototype effectively for XR. This workshop will bring together researchers and industry practitioners from different backgrounds to discuss the future of prototyping for VR, AR, and 3D User Interfaces, and help chart a course for the future of XR prototyping techniques.</p>

                                <p>The 1st Workshop on Gaze and Eye Movement in Interaction in XR (GEMINI) aims to reflect on the research agenda for gaze-based interaction in extended reality (XR). This is especially important due to the growing integration of eye-tracking technology in modern headsets, which presents significant research opportunities. Researchers and practitioners are invited to contribute and discuss their original research, opinions, and work-in-progress that explore the intricacies of gaze in XR.The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from different domains to discuss gaze-based research, such as 3D user interfaces, applications, and gaze analysis in XR, and to reflect on the current state and future directions of gaze-based interaction in XR.</p>

                                <p>IEEEVR and ISMAR are premier venues for mixed reality (XR) research that converges hundreds of researchers across disciplines and spectrums of research that includes both technical and human aspects of XR. However, at IEEEVR only 15% of first paper authors are women, and further, approximately 95% of the global population is excluded from VR research resulting in poor generalizability. In addition, Ethics informing XR research has been identified as one of the grand challenges facing human-computer interaction research today, with the replication crisis featuring transparency as a critical step for remediation. These factors make formal discussions surrounding inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility, transparency, and ethics in XR not only timely, but necessary.</p>

                                <p>Over the past 30 years, many research organizations established large-scale immersive visualization laboratories. Some have been very successful, but others are no longer around. With the recent availability of COTS virtual reality devices, the need for larger immersive visualization laboratories comes into question. Some immersive visualization laboratories have moved away from large scale facilities due to the cost of maintaining these more elaborate systems. But can immersive visualization requirements be satisfied solely using COTS VR devices used by researchers in their own office? The goal of this workshop is to gather practitioners from immersive visualization laboratories to share their success stories, information about their hardware setups and the software they used and/or developed. We also hope to bring visualization practitioners together to advance the way our field works with immersive visualization hardware and software frameworks for a sustainable immersive visualization laboratory.</p>

While navigation is one of the most fundamental forms of user interaction required in almost every XR application, existing research still leaves a plethora of open research questions regarding the conceptual design, technical realization, and systematic evaluation of navigation interfaces for particular use cases. In addition, a growing challenge for the research community is the reproducibility of existing interfaces and evaluations, where recent meta-analyses have shown deficiencies in terms of the descriptions of experimental setups, the scientific rigor of the underlying research processes, and the generalizability of results.</p>

                                <p>Recent advances in VR display technologies have led to high-resolution, ergonomic, and - critically - low-cost head-mounted displays (HMDs). Advances in commercial input devices and interaction techniques have arguably not kept pace with these advances in display systems. For instance, most HMDs include tracked input devices, but these "controllers" are still fairly similar to the earliest examples of 3D controllers used in the 1980s. Interaction in commercial VR systems has similarly lagged; despite many advances in 3D interaction in the past three decades of VR research, interaction in commercial systems largely relies on classical techniques. This full-day workshop will bring together researchers and industry practitioners to discuss and experience the future of input devices for Virtual/Augmented/Mixed/Extended Reality and 3D User Interfaces and help chart a course for the future of 3D interaction techniques. We invite authors to submit 4-6 page papers and of all accepted submissions are strongly encouraged to demonstrate their novel input device and interaction techniques in an interactive demo format following their presentation.</p>

                                <p>Virtual Reality (VR) allows unique experiences where users can embody avatars that go beyond the limit of their real bodies. Such avatars may also be called dissimilar avatars as they differ from users' real bodies by either subtle modifications (e.g., another body proportion) or more extreme body changes (e.g., robot, animal, etc.). Their diverse applications range from the film industry to environmental purposes. However, the study of dissimilar avatars is a complex multidisciplinary topic and a lot of challenges remain to be overcome to fully take advantage of their benefits (lack a common understanding, complex algorithms for animation, multisensory feedback, difficulties to provide a Sense of Embodiment, etc.). The goal of PANDAS is to present state-of-the-art research on dissimilar avatars, show examples of control/perception/interaction/animation with such bodies, and discuss future work and requirements for improving and developing new types of avatars.</p>

                                <p>Today, Extended Reality (XR) technologies are becoming fundamental across a wide variety of application domains. Areas in which XR technologies and, in particular, immersive experiences have been successfully introduced and expanding daily, range from traditional areas, such as entertainment and video game production, to novel scenarios, such as industry, healthcare, smart cities, and autonomous vehicles, to mention a few. Moreover, the availability of new hardware and software tools makes it easier to design and develop "3D reconstructions", "digital twins" and "simulations", which have now become pivotal components in many XR applications. The ReDigiTS workshop aims to attract a collection of high-quality submissions describing research activities targeting the next generation of immersive experiences, reporting the latest ideas, methodologies, applications, evaluations, case studies, prototype implementations, preliminary results, and demos concerning 3D reconstruction, digital twinning, and simulation in VR and related technologies.</p>

                                <p>Today, many tools, are available to design believable virtual humans and crowds in immersive virtual environments, interacting with each other and with users. A wide range of applications can be envisioned, ranging from virtual tour to the creation of virtual platforms for training or studying human behavior, or even the reproduction of a concert. However, several challenges are still open concerning the multimodal representation of interactions, the responsiveness of virtual humans to the user at the verbal and non-verbal communication levels, or the understanding of the impact of individual and situational factors in social interactions in populated environments. The goal of the VHCIE workshop is to generate discussions on the latest research related to these issues in a cross-community approach. VHCIE 2024 also aims to be more inclusive, giving students the opportunity to present their ongoing projects and questions in an informal mentoring session.</p>

                                <p>The Workshop on Immersive Sickness Prevention is intended to foster discussion between researchers, developers, and practitioners interested in addressing cybersickness, one of the most significant usability issues in the virtual reality field. Although immersive technologies have been advancing rapidly, their rate of public adoption has been slowed by the fact that many users experience physical discomfort during or after the use of VR devices, with symptomatic characteristics similar to motion sickness. Furthermore, studies have consistently shown that motion sickness disproportionately affects women, and concerns have been raised about the existence of inequitable barriers for engaging with immersive media. The workshop program will include primary research papers that report study results, novel interaction techniques, or technological interventions aimed towards understanding and mitigating cybersickness, as well as position papers describing early-stage concepts, preliminary results, or case studies from industry.</p>

                                <p>The 1st Workshop on Extended Reality for Knowledge Work (xrWORKS) aims to bring together researchers interested in using extended reality technologies for supporting knowledge work. This workshop aims to create a space where both academic and industry researchers can discuss their experiences and visions to continue growing the impact of XR in the future of work. Through a combination of position papers, in-person demonstrations, and a brainstorming session, we aim to reach a more complete understanding of the space and debate future research agenda. "KnowledgeWork" follows the definition initially coined by Drucker (1966) where information workers apply theoretical and analytical knowledge to develop products and services. Much of the work might be detached from physical documents, artifacts, or specific work locations and is mediated through digital devices such as laptops. Workers include architects, engineers, scientists, design thinkers, public accountants, lawyers, and academics, whose job is to "think for a living".</p>
