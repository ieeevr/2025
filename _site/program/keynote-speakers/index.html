    <center><big><strong>XR Access: Making Virtual and Augmented Reality Accessible to People with Disabilities</strong></big></center>
    <center><small>Monday, 18 March 2024, 10:15 - 11:15 (Orlando, Florida USA UTC-4)<br />Room: Fantasia Ballroom H </small></center>
        
    <p>
        <strong>Abstract</strong><br />
        <p>As augmented and virtual reality (XR) technologies gain traction, they remain almost completely inaccessible to people with disabilities. How can a blind person walk around a virtual bar in Horizon Worlds? How can a Deaf person have a conversation with a friend in VR Chat? It is critical to think about these challenges and address them proactively before people with disabilities are left further behind.</p><p>In this talk, I will present XR Access, which I co-founded to promote XR accessibility research and practice. For the last five years, XR Access has been bringing together practitioners, researchers, and advocates in conferences and seminars, developing resources, and supporting students in XR accessibility. I will present a taste of XR accessibility research, and outline ways in which you too can join this movement.</p>

        <strong>Abstract</strong><br />
        <p>This 30-minute conference delves into the remarkable story of Laval, a small French town that emerged as a global center for research and development in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). Since the inception of Laval Virtual in 1999, this event has been pivotal in bringing together pioneers, researchers, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts of interactive and immersive technologies from around the globe.</p><p>The speaker, Simon, will begin with a historical overview of Laval Virtual, highlighting how an intuition transformed Laval into an internationally recognized hub of innovation. Simon will share anecdotes from the early editions, emphasizing the evolution of the technologies showcased and how they reflected and shaped industry trends.</p><p>The discussion will then focus on the key factors contributing to Laval's success and global prominence in the VR field, including the local community's commitment, support from both public and private institutions, and Laval Virtual's ability to foresee and integrate technological advancements.</p><p>The presentation will also illustrate how Laval has become a venue for exchange and collaboration, fostering innovation and the development of groundbreaking VR/AR projects. Simon will provide concrete examples of technologies and projects that have emerged from this international collaboration.</p><p>In conclusion, the conference will consider the future of VR and AR, drawing from Laval's example to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the industry. The speaker will encourage reflection on how communities and countries can draw inspiration from Laval to foster innovation within their own technological ecosystems.</p><p>This conference celebrates the pioneering spirit of Laval and serves as an invitation to view the future of immersive technologies with optimism and ambition.</p>
