    <p>
        The Doctoral Consortium at IEEE VR 2024 is a concentrated event where students present their research interests, plans, and results to a panel of researchers in related fields and receive specific and constructive feedback, including opportunities to meet with mentors one-on-one. Accepted students will be expected to give in-depth presentations of their research and will receive valuable comments from mentors. Additionally, accepted students will have the chance to create a poster about their work to allow IEEE VR 2024 attendees to quickly familiarize themselves with each otherâ€™s work These posters will also be shown to the broader audience during the conference poster session. Accepted students will have the option to publish their two-page extended abstract in the conference proceedings and to be included in the IEEE VR 2024 online program. Abstracts may be archived in the IEEExplore digital library.
