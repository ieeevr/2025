panel-XR,"Where will extended reality and AI take us?",Wednesday 12th,15:15,16:15,"Saint-Malo, France UTC+1","This year, for the first time, IEEE VR will include a mixed reality panel, occurring simultaneously in VR and displayed live on the screen of the plenary room. Panelists will be equipped with a VR headset. Each panelist will be represented by a virtual body that resembles their own appearance. As well as the human panelists there will be a virtual agent of a very well-known historic researcher who was critical to the topic of the discussion, based on Large Language Model (LLM) and also represented by an avatar. This special guest will observe the panel discussion and occasionally will comment through GPT-based speech generation. The panel will be in two stages. First, there will be a discussion where the panelists are in VR in the same shared environment, but potentially located in different physical places around the convention centre or on the plenary stage. Second, they will come together physically on stage to discuss the experience including with the audience.<br> The scientific objective of the panel is to foster discussion about the future of AI and XR and how they are interrelated and will influence one another. AI can be used to help construct XR applications including everything from the design, modeling, and  programming, and also AI can be used in real time during an application - as in the example we are demonstrating with this panel. The general idea is based on the goals of constructing and testing the technology for AI to be used in meetings. Every meeting has an objective (even if it is just to ‘hang out’ and have fun), and the idea is to explore the extent to which AI can help the meeting realise its objectives, especially when things go wrong, such as in cases of abuse or harassment.<br> Also there are fundamental ethical issues raised through the use of AI, especially considering the European Union’s AI Act. For example, will it even be legal to have virtual human characters controlled by an AI in XR applications outside of research? We look forward to this exciting panel that will discuss issues relevant to all attendees of IEEE VR 2025!","The panel relies on the VR United tool designed by Dr Ramon Oliva in the Event Lab, Universitat de Barcelona within the frame of the European project GuestXR.",Chateaubriand
