The game is produced following our Advanced Interactive Digital Storytelling methodology (A-IDS) which extends interactive digital storytelling with gameplays. We will present the whole production workflow, from story idea, creation of scenarios for the educational and gameplay parts, filming of actors on green screen,  filming 360 videos, compositing VR videos with actors and ambisonics sound, digitization of museum exhibits, to VR application development and finalization of the product. The tutorial will show how interdisciplinary experts from archeology, history, screenplay writing, filming, visual arts, make-up and costume design, set design, sound and music production, and software development collaborate and create a high-quality educational game for museums.
