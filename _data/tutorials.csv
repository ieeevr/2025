T1,Tutorial 1,Production of Immersive VR games for Cultural Heritage,"Selma Rizvic","Saturday,&nbsp;March&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2025",8:30,10:00,Saint-Malo France UTC+1,Vauban 1,"Prof. Selma Rizvic, PhD University of Sarajevo - Faculty of Electrical Engineering Bojan Mijatovic, MA Sarajevo School of Science and Technology","The goal of this tutorial is to show the production workflow for the creation of a VR serious game for cultural heritage presentation. The game is produced following our Advanced Interactive Digital Storytelling methodology (A-IDS) which extends interactive digital storytelling with gameplays. We will present the whole production workflow, from story idea, creation of scenarios for the educational and gameplay parts, filming of actors on green screen,  filming 360 videos, compositing VR videos with actors and ambisonics sound, digitization of museum exhibits, to VR application development and finalization of the product. The tutorial will show how interdisciplinary experts from archeology, history,screenplay writing, filming, visual arts, make-up and costume design, set design, sound and music production, and software development collaborate and create a high-quality educational game for museums. The presented case study is the SHELeadersVR application about female rulers from medieval Balkans countries, installed in five museums in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Albania.",,,,,
