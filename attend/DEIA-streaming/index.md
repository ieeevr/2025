        <strong style="color: black">IEEE VR 2024: The 31<sup>st</sup> IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces </strong>

        March 16-21, 2024 | Orlando, Florida USA
        <br>
    </p>
    <h2>DEIA ACCESSIBILITY STREAM</h2>
    <p>
        The IEEE VR 2024 DEIA Accessibility Streaming is intended to provide support for students, early-career researchers (graduate students and postdocs), established researchers, or other interested individuals who would have liked to attend IEEE Virtual Reality 2024 but face <strong>financial</strong>, <strong>physical</strong>, or <strong>other atypical barriers</strong> to attending the conference in person. This includes people who are d/Deaf, hard of hearing, or otherwise require captions; people who are blind and low vision; people with mobility challenges; and members of under-represented or historically marginalized groups. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Selected individuals will be provided access to live streaming of select IEEE VR 2024 sessions, e.g., the opening/closing ceremonies, keynote talks, and special sessions. Due to IEEE and other restrictions of the public broadcasting of conference content, DEIA Accessibility Streaming will be restricted to those individuals who demonstrate a need through our application. 
    </p>
    <h2>APPLICATION GUIDELINES AND PROCESS</h2>
    <p>
        We will be accepting applications through the end of the conference (i.e., Closing Ceremony, March 21st). Those selected for DEIA Accessibility Streaming access will be informed on a rolling basis as their applications are approved and provided with instructions to promptly access the stream. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Interested individuals may apply via this Google Form: <a href="https://forms.gle/5D54Ux7eu3sR9JC4A" target="_blank"> https://forms.gle/5D54Ux7eu3sR9JC4A</a>.
    </p>    
    <h2>DATA PROTECTION AND RETENTION</h2>
    <p>
        The information provided by the candidates will be accessible only to the members of the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility committee. The applicants can request for their information to be corrected or deleted at any time until the 31st of May 2024. For this, please write an email to <span class="deia"></span>. After the 31st of May, candidatesâ€™ answers to the application questions as well as their institutional/company affiliation will be deleted. Their remaining data will be anonymized and provided to the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility committee of future iterations of IEEE VR for statistical purposes.
    </p>
