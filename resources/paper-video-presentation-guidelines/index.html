	<p>
		While the presentations at IEEE VR 2025 will take place in person, we are committed to ensuring the conference's accessibility offering an online experience for attendees. To this end, plenary sessions will be streamed live, and paper presentations videos will be made available on the conference's on-line channels. Below, you will find guidelines for creating the video.

	<ul>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> The videos should have a duration of 10 minutes, corresponding to the regular presentation time.</li>
        <li><strong>Template:</strong> Use the IEEE VR 2025 template for your video, especially for the title page. The template can be found here: <a href="https://forms.gle/69cqSoWzhBCMSuHp6" target="_blank">IEEE VR 2025 Slide Templates</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution and Format:</strong> The video must be 1080p (HD - 1920x1080 progressive - Aspect ratio: 16:9) and in MP4 format (H.264 compression).</li>
        <li><strong>Subtitles:</strong> Subtitles are mandatory and must be included in your video.</li>
        <li><strong>File Size:</strong> The video file size must not exceed 250MB.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Content:</strong> You may include photos or videos of the authors, though this is not mandatory.</li>
