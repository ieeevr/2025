    <h2>The 32<sup style="text-transform:lowercase;">nd</sup> IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces </h2> 
    
    <p>
        The IEEE VR 2025 conference is over, and we were delighted to welcome you to Saint-Malo for this extraordinary week of scientific research in virtual, augmented and mixed reality!    
    </p> 
    <p>
        IEEE VR 2025 brought together nearly 1200 participants from 44 different countries. The scientific program was particularly rich and dense, with more than 200 scientific papers presented, 160 posters, 40 research demonstrations, 11 3DUI contest entries, 17 XR art pieces, and 14 exhibits! In all, over 600 publications associated with the IEEE VR 2025 conference are referenced in the IEEE Digital Library.<br>

        This year, we wanted to highlight several themes for our community. First of all, Art, with the introduction of a new track dedicated to artistic creation: the XR Gallery. This track offers a unique venue for artists and students to showcase works that push the boundaries of traditional art forms, demonstrating how immersive technologies can transform and revisit artistic expressions. Second, as a forward-thinking community, we recognize the importance of addressing the pressing issues of our world today. This year, we placed a special emphasis on sustainability, reflecting our commitment to making a positive impact on the world. Various actions were proposed to highlight and tackle environmental challenges, ensuring that our conference not only advances research and technology but also promotes a more sustainable future. This included a focus on reducing the carbon footprint of our conference by using eco-friendly materials for food and consumables wherever possible, and organizing a dedicated panel on this issue, which presented the carbon footprint of our conference and launched a discussion on the future of our conference model. Finally, IEEE VR is also strongly committed to diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and support programs, with the DEIA initiative involved from the very beginning of the organization. As an example and part of this commitment, specific grants have been made available to help with the conference costs. Additionally, the Student Volunteer (SV) program offered students the opportunity to participate actively in the conference. This year, the selection of SV has been particularly challenging for the SV chairs due to high demand, with over 250 submissions.

        Last but not least, none of this would have been possible without the unfailing commitment of a great many people, starting with the many members of the conference committee, but also our 60 student volunteers, and of course the local staff who worked tirelessly to make this event a tremendous success. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the colleagues who worked behind the scenes. Nothing would be possible without a close-knit team, driven by the common goal of delivering the best possible experience. Organizing such an event involves a colossal engagement on the part of researchers, engineers, students, support staff and our entire international community, with a very high level of personal investment, particularly in view of the ever-increasing number of submissions. We are very proud to have been part of this adventure, and honored by the trust placed in us by our collaborators. We are convinced that by sticking together, respecting our differences, leveraging our complementary skills and helping each other out, we can lift mountains and cross oceans!
